Upon looking at the various tech companies located throughout the USA, the company that most excites me is 
Cisco Networks based in California. Cisco is a hardware and software company that specializes networking hardware 
products as well as telecommunications products and licensed software products. The reason I chose Cisco is because 
the company resonates with me in terms of its far reach within the technological world and that its products are widely 
used to keep the computer world running and operating at ever growing speeds. Networking routers and switches were used 
every day at my recent internship to provide adequate access to the network at substantial speeds and to allow every single 
employee to complete their desired work. I am very much interested in Artificial Intelligence and its role in shaping not only 
the tech world but also its impact on human societies. The hardware aspects of AI do intrigue me more than the software aspects 
and this is because software runs off of hardware. Since Cisco specializes in creating the most up to date technology hardware, 
the future of AI becomes ever more prevalent in terms of its use and applications. The most challenging aspects of this industry 
is how to create the most sophisticated hardware systems without using too much energy and using lesser resources than before. 
For the remainder of my years, I would like to learn more about the hardware engineering that is involved with the creation of 
routers, switches, data storage products, and power systems. The reason for this notion is that since hardware dictates the rules 
of software applications, learning the mechanisms behind the hardware are of great importance to me. These mechanisms include the 
circuit boards, flow of electrons, quantum computing, how data is stored, atom interactions, and the chemical processes involved 
in batteries.
