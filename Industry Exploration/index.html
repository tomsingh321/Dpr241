Upon looking at the various tech companies located throughout the USA, the company 
that most excites me is Cisco Networks based in California. Cisco is a hardware and 
software company that specializes networking hardware products as well as telecommunications 
products and licensed software products. The reason I chose Cisco is because the company resonates 
with me in terms of its far reach within the technological world and that its products are widely used 
to keep the computer world running and operating at ever growing speeds. Networking routers and switches 
were used every day at my recent internship to provide adequate access to the network at substantial speeds 
and to allow every single employee to complete their desired work. I am very much interested in Artificial 
Intelligence and its role in shaping not only the tech world but also its impact on human societies. The hardware 
aspects of AI do intrigue me more than the software aspects and this is because software runs off of hardware. 
Since Cisco specializes in creating the most up to date technology hardware, the future of AI becomes ever more 
prevalent in terms of its use and applications. The most challenging aspects of this industry is how to create the 
most sophisticated hardware systems without using too much energy and using lesser resources than before. For the 
remainder of my years, I would like to learn more about the hardware engineering that is involved with the creation 
of routers, switches, data storage products, and power systems. The reason for this notion is that since hardware 
dictates the rules of software applications, learning the mechanisms behind the hardware are of great importance to me. 
These mechanisms include the circuit boards, flow of electrons, quantum computing, how data is stored, atom interactions, 
and the chemical processes involved in batteries.
