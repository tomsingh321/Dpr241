Upon downloading the Git terminal and implementing it for the first time, the initial 
experience was frustrating. The terminal would not work according to the specifications 
that were required as part of the Git challenge project. Commands were not inserted properly 
and therefore no progress was made. However, I did receive help from other students as well as 
from the professor to fix my mistakes and therefore significant progress was made. Most confusing 
aspects of the Git terminal was locating the exact files that you wanted to work with. This meant 
that the file that you wanted to change/manipulate had to be declared on the command line. Screenshots 
from the terminal provide feedback in terms of what kind of mistakes were made and the corrections that 
were implemented. An example from the terminal includes the “Git Status” command, which allows the programmer 
to see the current files listed on a folder/drive/. As more and more commands were used I got better and better 
with using the terminal and thus uploading and updating files from the terminal to Github was relatively easy. 
Github use was complicated at first, however as time went on things got comfortable.
