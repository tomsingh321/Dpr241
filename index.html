<dd>DPR 241 is a course that introduces users to web page design by using various different methods of media and with the association of a  
<br>web hosting/creation website such as Github.</dd>
<strong>What is Github?</strong>
<dd>Github is a unique website that allows users, new and advanced, to create and share website code from scratch.
<br>This is accomplished by using repositories, branches, projects, sharing, pull requests, and coding!</dd></dl></dt></div>

<p><strong>Resume Project Reflection</strong></p>
<p>The skeleton framework is useful when creating applications, websites, or projects with minimal use of coding. 
<br>Main benefits of using this framework include the short usage of code, increased productivity because the code and 
<br>be used over and over again with minimum changes required. The main weakness associated with the skeleton framework 
<br>include organizing the grid in a way that makes a project look the way that a developer wants. When comparing with 
<br>the portfolio project using media queries, skeleton was harder to a certain extent. The reason for this notion is 
<br>that the CSS had to be coded using a grid system, whereas for the portfolio a grid was not specifically utilized. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Flexbox Project Reflection</strong></p>
<p>Flexbox grid system provides developers with a column and row type of structure to operate with. The main advantage 
<br>of this framework is that it resizes when you shrink or expand the webpage window. It is also useful for positioning and 
<br>aligning material on a webpage. Weaknesses associated with flexbox include it being not supported by all or some browsers 
<br>such as internet explorer. When compared to the previous responsive systems used in this course, flexbox is comparable to 
<br>Skeleton in terms of operation, usefulness, and programming. However, it is &ldquo;harder&rdquo; to use than the portfolio 
<br>homepage in terms of media queries and coding. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bootstrap Project Reflection</strong></p>
<p>The bootstrap framework allows developers with the ability to create forms, buttons, and other navigational materials for webpage and
<br>interface design. This project was completed using an existing external CSS code that is linked to the main webapage.
<br>This project was slighlty harder to complete than the previous projects, however in terms of speed it is slower than the flexbox
<br>and the resume assignments.
